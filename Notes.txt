Scripts ran for this project included setting up a timed automation process through my PythonAnywhere account.
I've used Twilio integration with WhatsApp to send text notifications to my phone number that was verified in the Twilio
 account setup process.

Due to a change in the law, as of January 31, 2024 no one is able to send a SMS message originating from a Toll-Free Number
 (TFN) within the US or Canada, unless the TFN has been verified, the user is vetted and content intended to be transmitted 
 is vetted too. This verification can take anywhere from 2-4 weeks which is a process I did not go through for the purpose 
 of this project. Instead I've used the WhatsApp integration with Twilio instead of an SMS message.
